\section*{Acknowledgement}

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors for solving all my questions during the weekly meeting. David Orme offered me an opportunity to study this interesting topic and many supports on statistical analysis in the project. Samraat Pawar provided lots of computing modules and solutions to my technical questions so that I have the ability to process the data and create machine-learning models using Python, Shell and R. James Rosindell provided me numerous ideas from the start of the project and suggestions for assigning topic labels in my topic model. Additionally, he arranged multiple meetings for providing me many useful feedbacks based on the draft of the project. In addition, I also would like to thank Yewshen Lin, who is one of my colleagues, for sharing his suggestions and experiences of using text-mining techniques. Moreover, a big thank you to Marina Papadopoulou, a student who graduated with an MSc in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution at Imperial College London, for the methods of the selection and assessment of topic models she introduced in the dissertation. Last but not least, many thanks to everyone in James' lab meeting for listening to my presentation and giving suggestions to me.
