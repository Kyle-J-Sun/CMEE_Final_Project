\section{Introduction}

Thermal performance curve (TPC) describes the relationship between biological traits (e.g. photosynthesis, respiration and growth rate) and temperature, which is an essential factor in ecology, biology and physiology \cite{huey_1989}. Due to the importance of TPC, numerous biological temperature-dependent rate models have been implemented, it has been increasingly important that using computer tools to ﬁt the model \cite{angilletta_2002}, many authors have taken advantages of programming language for model ﬁtting in their paper. However, the paper concerning the comparison between published models is scarce. Therefore, this project aims at giving a comparison between distinct models ﬁtting the thermal performance curve. The remaining sections in this report will be explained as follow. In section 2, a brief introduction of candidate models and an explanation of data preprocessing will be given, then I will explain the method and assessment tool used. In section 3, the results of the ﬁtted model will be explained. Next section will give a conclusion for the results and some future works that can be done.
