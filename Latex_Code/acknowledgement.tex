\section*{Acknowledgement}

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors for solving all my questions during the weekly meeting. David Orme offered me an opportunity to study this interesting topic and many supports on statistical analysis in the project. Samraat Pawar provided lots of computing modules and solutions to my technical questions so that I have the ability to process the data and create machine-learning models using Python, Shell and R. James Rosindell provided me with numerous ideas from the start of the project and suggestions for assigning topic labels in my topic model. Additionally, he arranged multiple meetings for providing many useful feedbacks based on the draft of the project. In addition, I also would like to thank Yewshen Lin, who is one of my colleagues, for sharing his suggestions and experiences of using text-mining techniques. Last but not least, many thanks to everyone in James' lab meeting for listening to my presentation and giving suggestions to me.
