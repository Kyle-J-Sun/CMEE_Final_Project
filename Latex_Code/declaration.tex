\section*{Declaration}

I can declare that I am the only person who is responsible for data collection, data cleaning, the development of methodology for the topic analysis, text mining and machine learning models used in this project. All information from other papers is appropriately referenced. I herewith certify that all works in my project are done by myself under the supervision of Dr. David Orme, Dr. Samraat Pawar and Dr. James Rosindell. David Orme provided suggestions for some statistical problems, James Rosindell shared the idea of using topic modelling techniques with me and provided some scientific papers related to my project. He also gave feedback on the draft of my project. Samraat Pawar provided supports for the technical questions in terms of Python, R and Latex and also offered useful suggestions for my draft of the project.
